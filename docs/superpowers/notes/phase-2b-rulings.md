Screenshots (`tests/snapshots/phase2b-before/`, taken against `npm run dev` on :5173):

- `1935-ride-golden.png` — golden-hour ride view; mangrove clumps on both banks read as fairly distinct silhouettes rather than one flat band, but the far shoreline across the water is a flat dark-green strip with no depth; palms along the near banks are evenly spaced in a row.
- `1975-bank-noon.png` — noon bank view; water reads teal/cyan rather than a noon blue-green; the near-bank mangrove clump is a flat dark mass with little internal shading, and the far shoreline is a continuous flat dark band; palms are evenly spaced in a single row along both banks.
- `1840-bank-noon.png` — same camera/lighting as the 1975 shot with a rowboat instead of the ferry; identical flat dark mangrove band along the far shoreline, teal noon water, and evenly spaced single-row palms on both banks.
- `1984-mouth-dawn.png` — pre-dawn, almost fully dark; the entire treeline on both sides is a single flat black silhouette band with no internal structure, most visible of all six shots.
- `1975-aerial-noon.png` — aerial view; the palm grid on the near shore is clearly visible as an evenly spaced planted-grid pattern rather than naturalistic clustering; the mangrove band hugging both banks of the channel is a thin, flat, uniformly dark line.
- `1975-bank-noon-high.png` — same framing as `1975-bank-noon.png` at `q=high`; teal noon water and flat dark mangrove band are still present, and the higher-resolution reflections reveal a blocky, pixelated fringe under the mangrove clumps on both banks where the reflection meets the waterline.
